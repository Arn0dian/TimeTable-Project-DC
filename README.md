# TimeTable-Project-DC
Time-Table Scheduling problem solved by Genetic Algorithm 
Part of Capstone Presentation XIM University.
A customized heuristic solution to the famous Time-Table problem involving the
concepts of Combinatorial Optimization [1] using Genetic Algorithms and Fuzzy
Logic methodologies in the form of an application. This would be made with the in-
tention of actually reducing the time taken by our school for the timetable-making
process.
